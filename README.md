Hello! This is the Sattadllc github repo.

Nothing too special happens around here. It is mostly the code organization setup for our web presence, as well as a storage area for our 3d related code and a few small projects.

If you're here, you're probably part of the team. Let us know if you need anything internall at @admin!
